export const bio= (`On a summery day, July 7th, 1993, while my family members were in a nearby pool I was born into a wave full of warm colors.
Twenty-nine years full of positive energy define me most.

 at the age of 4, I touched my mother's clothes for the first time; at the age of 5, I put on a show wearing my older sister's clothes and at 6 I tried to reach an interesting piece out of my father's poor sweater by cutting and coloring it.
At that same age, I joined a drawing class and have pursued painting for eleven years.
Various techniques from standard simple pencil drawings to coal, water and oil were exposed to me and led me to 3 exhibitions. 

Among my childhood favorite subjects to draw were giraffes, mermaids with colored fins, fairies wearing magical pink dresses, and brides wearing long, angelic gowns.

At the age of 17, I quit the drawing class.

A year later, I stopped drawing altogether.

For a while, I strayed far from the world of painting and design and attained a bachelor's degree in another field (long story) but never stopped loving art.

at 2019 i got back my inspiration for drawing in general and fashion design in particular.
at 2020 I realized that it is never too late to follow your dreams and decided to do something with my passion for fashion and enroll in a fashion course.
In this life anything worth building takes time, focus and dedication... what is sure that our dreams deserve nothing less. 

I'm blessed and thankful for everyone who pushed me through this step.

I love my family, I love my friends, I love my life, I love the planet I'm on...

I believe that life is happy no matter what and that everything I've been through had a significant part of my character and made the Adi of yesterday, Adi of today :) .

Always listen to the most resonant voice within you and look for quality
The quality of who you are is reflected in the standards you set for yourself.
Position yourself to live up to the rise of your own expectations.

I am Maria, and I'm going to be your conceptual model,  and designer. 

One who follows the crowd will usually go no further than the crowd, and i don't. 

You can learn a lot not because of choices but because of situations.

I felt that deep down inside I'm an artist and never used my potential. 

But time went by... and now I am ready to make a S T A T E M E N T.`) ;
